The use of blockchain to secure the voter database is possible. Distrbuted ledger technology or blockchain can be hyperlocalised solutions to enable voter verification and addition to voter eligibility list. This represents an exciting solution to the problem of eligible voters being left out due to delay in updation in ID.
